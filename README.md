# 1-14-16

JS function that generates a random number from 1000-9999.
One function then takes the whole number, i.e. 1740, and adds the numbers indiviually and outputs it. in this case = 12
The other function takes all the numbers and then drops the first number and adds it again, without the most left number. ie. 12, 11, 4, 0.
